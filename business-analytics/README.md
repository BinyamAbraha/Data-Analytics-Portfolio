# [Project Title]

## Overview
Briefly describe what this project is about and why you chose it.  
Example: This project looks at hospital readmission patterns and cost trends using a synthetic dataset I built in Python. The goal was to identify which factors most strongly influence readmission likelihood and hospital costs.

## Data
Explain where the data came from, how it was prepared, and what it represents.  
If you generated or cleaned it yourself, mention the tools or libraries used.  
Example: The dataset was created using the Faker library in Python and includes patient demographics, diagnosis codes, admission types, and costs. After generation, I cleaned and formatted the data using pandas before loading it into Power BI.

## Tools and Methods
List the main tools, libraries, and methods you used.  
Example:
- Python (pandas, numpy, faker)
- Power BI for dashboarding and visualization
- SQL for exploratory queries and data validation

## Analysis
Summarize what you explored or tested in the data.  
Example: I looked at correlations between length of stay and readmission rate, regional cost differences, and how diagnosis type affects cost of care.

## Results and Insights
Highlight your key findings in plain language.  
Example:
- Patients with longer stays had a higher probability of readmission.
- Cardiac and respiratory diagnoses had the highest average cost.
- The Northeast region showed the most consistent cost efficiency.

You can also include screenshots of your Power BI dashboard or visuals here once you have them.

## Takeaways
Wrap up with what you learned or what the results might mean for decision-making.  
Example: Hospitals can use these insights to target cost reduction and readmission prevention strategies more effectively.
