# Data Analytics Portfolio

This portfolio highlights some of the data analytics and business intelligence projects I’ve worked on during my time as a computer science student and data analyst intern. Each project reflects how I approach data from end to end — collecting or creating datasets, cleaning and analyzing them with Python and SQL, and building visual dashboards in Power BI to communicate results clearly.

## Projects

### Healthcare Analytics
**Hospital Readmission and Cost Analysis**  
A project exploring hospital readmission trends and cost drivers using a synthetic dataset I created in Python. Focused on identifying patterns in readmission rates, length of stay, and regional cost differences through Power BI dashboards.
